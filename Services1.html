<h2>Pit & Pipe installation</h2>
<p>We install pits and pipes that house and protect the cables and wires that connect different network nodes. We follow the industry standards and specifications for pit and pipe installation, ensuring the safety and reliability of the network.</p>

<h2>Pit & Pipe Network Construction</h2>
<p>We construct pit and pipe networks that span across different locations and environments, such as urban, rural, and remote areas. We use advanced equipment and techniques, such as directional drilling and hydro excavation, to minimize the impact on the surrounding landscape and infrastructure.</p>
</div>

<div class="aboutService">
<h2>Pit & Pipe Pre-Provisioning</h2>
<p>We pre-provision pits and pipes for future network expansion and upgrade, saving time and cost for our clients. We plan and design the pit and pipe layout according to the projected network demand and capacity, and we install the necessary conduits and enclosures for cabling provisioning.</p>

<h2>Open Trenching</h2>
<p>We perform open trenching to lay cables and pipes in the ground, using excavators and other machinery. We ensure the proper depth, width, and alignment of the trenches, and we restore the surface to its original condition after the work is done.</p>
</div>
	
<div class="aboutService">
<h2>Underground Service Locations</h2>
<p> We locate and identify the existing underground services, such as water, gas, electricity, and sewerage, before we commence any civil construction work. We use sophisticated detection devices and methods, such as ground penetrating radar and electromagnetic induction, to avoid any damage or disruption to the underground services.</p>

<h2>Civil Excavation</h2>
<p>We perform open trenching to lay cables and pipes in the ground, using excavators and other machinery. We ensure the proper depth, width, and alignment of the trenches, and we restore the surface to its original condition after the work is done.</p>
</div>

<div class="aboutService">
<h2>Directional Drilling</h2>
<p>We use directional drilling to install cables and pipes in the ground without digging trenches, which is especially useful for crossing roads, rivers, and other obstacles. We use specialized drill bits and steering systems to control the direction and angle of the drill, and we monitor the progress and position of the drill using sensors and cameras. We also use rock drilling to penetrate hard and dense materials, such as granite and basalt, using high-pressure water jets and diamond-tipped drill bits.</p>

<div class="aboutService">
<h2>Hydro Excavation</h2>
<p> We use hydro excavation to remove soil and debris from the ground using pressurized water and vacuum suction, which is safer and more precise than conventional digging methods. Hydro excavation reduces the risk of damaging the underground services and the environment, and it allows for easy access and visibility of the work area.</p>
</div>
	
<div class="aboutService">
<h2>Concrete Reinstatement</h2>
<p>We reinstate the concrete surfaces that have been disturbed or damaged by our civil construction work, such as footpaths, driveways, and kerbs. We use quality concrete materials and mixtures, and we follow the proper curing and finishing processes to ensure the strength and appearance of the reinstated surfaces.</p>

<div class="aboutService">
<h2>Internal Cable installations</h2>
<p>We install cables and wires inside buildings and premises, such as offices, homes, and factories, to connect them to the external network. We use appropriate cable types and sizes, such as coaxial, twisted pair, and optical fibre, and we route and secure them in a neat and orderly manner, using conduits, trays, and clips. We also test and terminate the cables and wires, and we label and document them for easy identification and maintenance.</p>
