<h2>Site Survey</h2>
<!-- Image or banner -->
<p>Site surveying is a crucial step for any telecommunication project, as it involves the collection and analysis of data about the site and the network requirements. At our company, we have the expertise and experience to conduct site surveying services for a range of telecommunication applications.</p>

<h2>Surveying</h2>
<p>Surveying is the process of measuring and mapping the physical features and characteristics of the site, such as the terrain, the buildings, the obstacles, and the existing infrastructure. We use advanced equipment and techniques to perform surveying, such as:
We use GPS devices and laser rangefinders to determine the coordinates and distances of the site and the network components, such as towers, poles, antennas, and cabinets.
We use drones and cameras to capture aerial and ground images and videos of the site and the surroundings, which help us to visualize and plan the network layout and design.
We use spectrum analyzers and signal generators to measure the radio frequency (RF) environment and the signal strength and quality of the site, which help us to identify and avoid any potential interference and optimize the network performance.

<h2>Scoping</h2>
<p>Scoping is the process of defining and documenting the scope and specifications of the network project, such as the objectives, the deliverables, the budget, and the timeline. We use reliable tools and methods to perform scoping, such as:
We use site survey checklists and questionnaires to collect all the information and data about the site and the network requirements, such as the cabling, the equipment, the electrical work, the wi-fi coverage, the data rates, the network capacity, and the quality of service.
We use site survey reports and diagrams to present and communicate the findings and recommendations of the site survey, such as the number and placement of the network components, the cable routing and termination, the power and grounding requirements, and the testing and verification procedures.

<h2>Rod Rope Proofing</h2>
<p>Rod rope proofing is the process of verifying and preparing the ducts and conduits for cable installation, using rods and ropes to clear and pull the cables through the ducts and conduits. We use professional equipment and techniques to perform rod rope proofing, such as:
We use rodders and duct rods to insert and push the rods through the ducts and conduits, using flexible and durable rods that can bend and twist through the ducts and conduits without breaking or kinking.
We use duct brushes and mandrels to attach and pull the brushes and mandrels through the ducts and conduits, using different sizes and shapes of brushes and mandrels that can clean and remove any dirt, debris, and obstructions from the ducts and conduits.
We use draw ropes and winches to attach and pull the ropes through the ducts and conduits, using strong and smooth ropes that can withstand the tension and friction of the cable hauling and jointing.
