<h2>Cable Hauling & Jointing</h2>
<p>Cable hauling and jointing are essential processes for telecommunication networks, as they involve the installation and connection of cables that carry data and voice signals. At our company, we have the expertise and experience to deliver high-quality cable hauling and jointing services for a range of telecommunication applications.</p>

<h2>Optic Fibre</h2>
<p>Optic fibre is a type of cable that uses light to transmit data at high speeds and over long distances. It is ideal for broadband and wireless networks, as it offers high bandwidth, low attenuation, and immunity to electromagnetic interference. We use advanced equipment and techniques to haul and joint optic fibre cables, such as:
<li>We use cable blowing machines to insert optic fibre cables into pre-installed conduits, using compressed air and a pushing mechanism. This method reduces the friction and stress on the cable, and allows for faster and easier installation.</li>
<li>We use fusion splicing machines to join optic fibre cables, using heat to melt and fuse the fibre ends together. This method ensures a low-loss and high-strength joint, and allows for precise alignment and protection of the fibre cores.</li>
<li>We use optical time-domain reflectometers (OTDRs) to test and verify the quality and performance of the optic fibre cables and joints, using pulses of light to measure the length, loss, and defects of the fibre.	</li>

<h2>Copper</h2>
<p>Copper is a type of cable that uses electrical signals to transmit data and voice over twisted pairs of wires. It is widely used for telephony and data networks, as it offers low cost, easy installation, and compatibility with existing infrastructure. We use reliable equipment and techniques to haul and joint copper cables, such as:
<li>We use cable hauling machines to pull copper cables through underground ducts or overhead poles, using winches, ropes, and rollers. This method ensures a smooth and safe installation, and allows for proper tension and clearance of the cable.</li>
<li>We use crimping tools to join copper cables, using connectors and terminals to fasten and secure the wire ends together. This method ensures a solid and durable joint, and allows for easy termination and identification of the cable pairs.</li>
<li>We use cable testers to test and verify the quality and performance of the copper cables and joints, using electrical signals to measure the continuity, resistance, and polarity of the wires.	</li>
