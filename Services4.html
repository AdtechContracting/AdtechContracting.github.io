<h2>Grundodrill 4X and ACS130</h2>
<p>The Grundodrills are directional drilling machines that we use to install cables and pipes in the ground without digging trenches. They are compact and powerful machines that can drill through different types of soil and rock, and they have a steering system that allows us to control the direction and angle of the drill. They also have a tracking system that monitors the progress and position of the drill using sensors and cameras. The Grundodrills help us to:
<li>Save time and cost by reducing the need for excavation and restoration of the surface.</li>
<li>Minimize the impact on the environment and the existing infrastructure by avoiding open trenching and crossing obstacles.</li>
<li>Ensure the quality and performance of the cables and pipes by preventing damage and stress during installation.</li>

<h2>Wacker Neuson Excavators</h2>
<p>The Wacker Neuson Excavators are excavators that we use to perform open trenching and civil excavation. They are versatile and agile machines that can dig, lift, and move soil and debris, and they have different attachments, such as buckets, hammers, and augers, that can perform various functions. The Wacker Neuson Excavators help us to:
<li>Prepare the site for the installation of telecommunication equipment, such as towers, poles, antennas, and cabinets, by removing any unwanted materials and leveling and compacting the ground.</li>
<li>Lay cables and pipes in the ground, using excavators and other machinery, by ensuring the proper depth, width, and alignment of the trenches.</li>
<li>Restore the surface to its original condition after the work is done, by filling and compacting the trenches and reinstating the concrete surfaces.</li>

<h2>Vacuum Excavation Truck</h2>
<p>The vacuum excavation truck is a truck that we use to perform hydro excavation, which is a method of removing soil and debris from the ground using pressurized water and vacuum suction. It is safer and more precise than conventional digging methods, as it reduces the risk of damaging the underground services and the environment, and it allows for easy access and visibility of the work area. The vacuum excavation truck helps us to:
<li>Locate and identify the existing underground services, such as water, gas, electricity, and sewerage, before we commence any civil construction work, using sophisticated detection devices and methods.</li>
<li>Clear and prepare the ducts and conduits for cable installation, using rods, ropes, brushes, and mandrels, to remove any dirt, debris, and obstructions from the ducts and conduits.</li>
<li>Dispose of the soil and debris that we excavate from the ground, using the vacuum suction and the spoil tank, to transport and dump the load at the desired location.</li>
